Note that you only need to install the k3d client, which will create a k3s cluster using the right Docker image.

Once installed, configure the completion with your preferred shell (bash, zsh, powershell), for instance with zsh:

k3d completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_k3d
 source .zshrc

Check installation with:

```
$ k3d --help
