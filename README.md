# k3d - Headstart

- Based on "k3d" at https://github.com/rancher/k3d

- Based on "K3S + K3D = K8S : a new perfect match for dev and test" at https://www-sokube-ch.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.sokube.ch/amp/k3s-k3d-k8s-a-new-perfect-match-for-dev-and-test

- Based on "Introduction to k3d: Run K3s in Docker" at https://www.suse.com/c/introduction-k3d-run-k3s-docker-src/

In short:

- k3d creates containerized k3s clusters. This means, that you can spin up a multi-node k3s cluster on a single machine using docker.

***Note***: k3s is the lightweight Kubernetes distribution by Rancher: rancher/k3s
